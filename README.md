# Projects
This repository contains a few of my (more complex) c++/Java projects as well as C# scripts from my Virtual Reality project!
# C++ Projects - Completed during Spring 2023 semester in Data Structures at OU

  Project2.cpp : Read a file that contains a table (2D array) of "records" (strings) including various operations (characters) to perform on certain rows/columns.         Examples include: sort a row or column in alphabetical order, search the table for specific record, etc.

  Project4.cpp : Perform various operations on block chains and block networks. Utilize transactions, timestamps, and other properties of blocks to store in blocks,       block chains, and block networks. Good demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming here.

  Project6.cpp : Read a file of insert/remove commands and strings. Take a given string, generate a hash value via hash function, and insert it into ordered and           undordered maps. Also handle collisions in the case that keys generate the same values. Run a series of timed experiments to understand how large file inputs affect     compilation time.

# Java Projects - Completed during Fall 2022 semester in Programming Structures and Abstractions
Please note, for simplicity and organization purposes I have excluded child class files. 

Blocks.java : Read information from a .csv file to store data into Block and its child classes. Perform various operations on blocks and block chains. Implement function that determines unique blocks based on its properties.

Main.java : Implemented a GUI that allows users to interact with various models of blocks and their properties. Used JavaFX and JFreeChart.
# C# Scripts - Completed during Summer 2023 for VR Project
I am attaching a few C# scripts that I used in my VR project. I utilized Unity software and attached these scripts to game objects for custom behaviors. Documentation is not provided as they are very short and simple scripts!
