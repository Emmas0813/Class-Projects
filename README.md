# Projects
This repository contains a few of my (more complex) c++/Java projects!
# C++ Projects - Completed during Spring 2023 semester in Data Structures at OU

Project2.cpp : Read a file that contains a table (2D array) of "records" (strings) including various operations (characters) to perform on certain rows/columns. Examples include: sort a row or column in alphabetical order, search the table for specific record, etc.

Project4.cpp : Perform various operations on block chains and block networks. Utilize transactions, timestamps, and other properties of blocks to store in blocks, block chains, and block networks. Good demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming here.

Project6.cpp : Read a file of insert/remove commands and strings. Take a given string, generate a hash value via hash function, and insert it into ordered and undordered maps. Also handle collisions in the case that keys generate the same values. Run a series of timed experiments to understand how large file inputs affect compilation time.
